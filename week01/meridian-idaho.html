    <h1>Meridian, Idaho</h1>
    <img src="./images/the-village-at-meridian.jpg" alt="The Village in Meridian, Idaho">
    <p>This city houses a place called, "The Village". I often go there when I'm feeling sad. There are several shops
        with colorful lights down one of the mainstreets and a fountain in the middle of a set of strip malls. You can
        go to fine dining, fast food, a movie, and a sweets shop without needing to walk very far.</p>
    <p>Another thing I like about Meridian is that it is less crowded than the nearby capital of Idaho, "Boise", and it
        still maintains
        thriving business and clean areas to walk around and enjoy. It doesn't have quite as many
        trees as some of the nearby cities, but it is still pleasant.</p>
