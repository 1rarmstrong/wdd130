        <p>I'm just a guy who likes pickleball, wants to finish school, and make enough money to more easily raise a
            family. I began college shortly after my mission around nine years ago. After a variety of mental health
            issues and traumatic experiences, I slowed down in my pursuit of higher education and attempted to seek
            healing through God and trusted others. I'm happy to report that I've made some progress and have hope for
            more to come.</p>

        <img src="images/idaho.jpg" alt="Image of Idaho">
        <p>Idaho is in the northwest of the United States. It has large forests, desserts, lakes, and mountains. It is
            just north
            of Utah and appears to have been taken into what is known as 'the bubble': another way of referring to a
            large culture
            of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
