        <p>Idaho is in the northwest of the United States. It has large forests, desserts, lakes, and mountains. It is
            just north
            of Utah and appears to have been taken into what is known as 'the bubble': another way of referring to a
            large culture
            of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
